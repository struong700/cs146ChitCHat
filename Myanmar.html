           I LOVE AND HATE THIS COUNTRY. I LOVE THE TREES AND PLANTS. BUT I CANT STAND THE FOOD. I LOVE THE WILDLIFE AND MOUNTAIN FORMATIONS. BUT THE FOOD WAS NOT GOOD. #MAYBEVISIT.

            Dear @Karen, how can you be so blind to such wonderful food. Mohinga is so delicious and is something you need to wake up to. Myanmar is known for such good food. Try refeining your palette before you come back to Myanmar.

            The food here is good. I adore the physical formations in Myanmar. This place is super instagrammable and all my friends back home are in love with the country now.

            My brother and I went here for a week and we made so many memories together. I never bonded with him before this trip and I can thank Myanmar for it. There a bunch of cool things you can do here with your family or friends.
