          <p>
            Brazil is so much more than the country that hosted the World Cup whose team lost in 7-1 fashion. Brazil has so many awesome landmarks to see and when you plan your trip here, you defeintly have to see Cristo Redentor.

          <p>
            You can't call yourself a true traveler until you see the beaches and oceans of Brazil for yourself. There are views here that will blow your mind and ruin any idea you had of what a perfect beach should be.

            Watch out for possible scams and crimes! My bag got stolen while I was in Brazil and I won't get it back any time soon.

            The food here is to die for! I can not believe on the meals I was missing out on. If I had the money, I would personally buy and move a resteraunt in Brazil to my house!
