            A true gyro can only be found here. The absolute perfection of perfectly cooked lamb in a wrap with veggies is to die for. The Gourmet says that Greece is a must visit for the food. And trust me, people here will feed you until you are about to explode.

           Greece was alright. The food was amazing, but the actual country wasn't that intresting to me. There were some cool statues and landmarks, but the history wasn't intresting for me. If you like ancient history, check out Greece.

            So many places you can check on foot and you don't even need a car to experince the best things that Greece can offer. A bike or a scooter can take you around the city! It is an awesome experince riding a scooter around Athens!

            You need to check Athens when you come to Greece. Athens has parks, zoos and a wonderful beach. I seen a bunch of reviews talking about food and I agree, the food is wonderful. Would highly recommend.
