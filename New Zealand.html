            If you come to New Zealand, please understand that you need to see the ocean and beaitfuly hidden oasis scattered throughout New Zealand. I know too many people that have come to New Zealand and were disappointed by the country. Well duh, when you come to New Zealand, you come for the water.

            Australia is not comparable New Zealand. But I will say that New Zealand is very diverse in its ecology, culture, and geography.

            The seafood here is so fresh. Some places even catch what you cook.

            New Zealand is great. New Zealand doesn't have the Sydney Opera House, but has lots of other cool stuff.
